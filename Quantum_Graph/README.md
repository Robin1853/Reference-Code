# Quantum Graph Learning and Simulation

This project combines two quantum approaches to characterize and learn properties of Ising-like Hamiltonians defined on graphs.

## VQTE

**Variational Quantum Thermalization via Imaginary Time Evolution** (VQTE) uses Qiskitâ€™s `VarQITE` and `SciPyImaginaryEvolver` to approximate ground states and compare them to exact imaginary time evolution.  
A custom Hamiltonian is constructed based on graph topology, weights, and biases. Auxiliary observables and energy expectation values are tracked and visualized throughout the evolution.

## QuantumGraph

Implements a **Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Network** (QGRNN) in PennyLane to reconstruct the structure of an unknown Hamiltonian.  
Using a SWAP test between evolved and reference states, the QGRNN learns to approximate the original Hamiltonian via gradient descent.  
Matrix visualizations and parameter comparisons illustrate the learning performance.

The overall workflow demonstrates **forward and inverse problems** in graph-based quantum systems:  
simulation via VQTE and structure reconstruction via a QGRNN model.
